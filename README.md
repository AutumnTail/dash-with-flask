# dash-with-flask
Simple example of integrating dash into the flask framework

This is a demonstration on how to get [dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) working inside of a flask framework. 

I created this because I myself had trouble figuring out this setup given the documentation out there. From the plotly forums to the documentatoin for werkzeug, flask and dash, none had a complete living example that tied it all together. It took some effort and learning, but in the end I figured it out and thought I would share with the rest of the world wide web.
